      "We are pleased to introduce Cause Innovation Bootcamp (CIB), a project that aims to train researchers interested in EA, while vetting new potential cause areas in Global Health and Development. We achieve this by taking research fellows through a training bootcamp that upskills them on the basics of evidence-based research and then getting them to produce a shallow report (using a standardised template) of a cause area, all whilst being supported by a senior mentor. These reports will then be posted on the EA Forum, and be sent to relevant organisations who the research might be of particular interest to, and for whom it might inform their decision-making. Cause areas are selected through a rough prioritisation which helps us identify which ones we think are most likely to be promising. We are currently running a pilot program for 5-6 fellows (7th Nov. 2022- 20th Dec. 2022).  Applications are open until 30th Oct. 2022 (Sunday)- please apply on the following application form if you are interested.\n",

      "Why this project?\n",
      "\n",
      "We identified a few primary bottlenecks in the research infrastructure within EA:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. A relative lack of novel research exploring new problem areas and interventions that might beat the current bar and/or be as impactful as current EA focus areas within global health and development- We think that this is important because our ability to most effectively do the most good depends on our ability to either fund or found new interventions within cause areas. We try to solve this by having created a comprehensive database of cause areas within global health and global development, and roughly prioritising them based on burden of disease/number of people affected and tractability. By producing shallow reports on topics that might be promising and are currently under-investigated, we hope that this can reveal potential ‘blindspots’ and ‘low-hanging fruit’. Our database and all shallow reports written will be an open-access resource available to the entire EA research community.\n",
      "  2. A relative lack of quality researchers (both current and emerging) approaching prioritisation from an EA lens- We think, given that quality research is essential to fund or found promising interventions, researchers are pretty central to the long-term health and strength of the EA movement. We aim to mobilise two groups of talent: (1) motivated EAs who want to be involved in research, but don't currently have the requisite skills and experience, (2) existing researchers in the broader GHD (Global Health and Development) community who might be interested in approaching research from an EA perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      " What do we do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Our theory of change is below\n",
      "\n",
      "Our current assumption is that roughly 50% of the impact is achieved by introducing more good researchers to the EA research ecosystem[1]. We would estimate that the other 50% of the impact to come from research produced through the training program[2]. We aren’t confident about these estimates, and will evaluate these at the end of our pilot program; depending on their results, we might emphasise parts of this Theory of Change that generate the most impact. \n",

      "\n",
      "  * Self-study of training modules on research skills- We have 6-8 lessons covering various key research topics (background research, theory of change, evaluating interventions, cost-effectiveness analyses, decision-making tools and how to write up your research, and other research skills), with each lesson linked to specific aspects of the shallow report that you write.\n",

      "  * People living in slums: Around 1 billion people worldwide live in slums according to UN Habitat’s definition. This research project involves asking how living in a slum impacts someone’s health, happiness and income, which interventions are most cost-effective at alleviating some of the negative consequences and who is working on and funding the issue. \n",

      "\n",
      "### What Squiggle Is\n",
      "\n",
      "  * A simple programming language for doing math with probability distributions.\n",
      "  * An embeddable language that can be used in Javascript applications. This means you can use Squiggle directly in other websites.\n",
      "  * A tool to encode functions as forecasts that can be embedded in other applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### What Squiggle Is Not\n",
      "\n",
      "  * A complete replacement for enterprise Risk Analysis tools. (See Crystal Ball, @Risk, Lumina Analytica)\n",
      "  * A probabilistic programming language. Squiggle does not support Bayesian inference. (Confusingly, \"Probabilistic Programming Language\" really refers to this specific class of language and is distinct from \"languages that allow for using probability.\")\n",
      "  * A tool for substantial data analysis. (See programming languages like Python or Julia)\n",
      "  * A programming language for anything other than estimation.\n",
      "  * A visually-driven tool. (See Guesstimate and Causal)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Simple and readable syntax, especially for dealing with probabilistic math.\n",
      "  * Fast for relatively small models. Useful for rapid prototyping.\n",
      "  * Optimized for using some numeric and symbolic approaches, not just Monte Carlo.\n",
      "  * Embeddable in Javascript.\n",
      "  * Free and open-source (MIT license).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Weaknesses\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Limited scientific capabilities.\n",
      "  * Much slower than serious probabilistic programming languages on sizeable models.\n",
      "  * Can't do backward Bayesian inference.\n",
      "  * Essentially no support for libraries or modules (yet).\n",
      "  * Still very new, so a tiny ecosystem.\n",
      "  * Still very new, so there are likely math bugs.\n",
      "  * Generally not as easy to use as Guesstimate or Causal, especially for non-programmers.\n",

      "## Using Squiggle\n",
      "\n",
      "You can currently interact with Squiggle in a few ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "Playground\n",
      "\n",
      "The Squiggle Playground is a friendly tool for working with small models and making prototypes. You can make simple, shareable links.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visual Studio Code Extension\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a simple Virtual Studio Code extension for running and visualizing Squiggle code. We find that VS Code is a helpful editor for managing larger Squiggle setups.\n",
      "\n",
      "(This example is a playful, rough experiment of an estimate of Ozzie's life output.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Typescript Library\n",
      "\n",
      "Squiggle is built using Rescript, and is accessible via a simple Typescript library. You can use this library to either run Squiggle code in full, or to call select specific functions within Squiggle (though this latter functionality is very minimal).\n",
      "\n",
      "React Components Library\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the components used in the playground and documentation are available in a separate component NPM repo. You can see the full Storybook of components here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Observable\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use Squiggle Components in Observable notebooks. Sam Nolan put together an exportable Observable Notebook of the main components. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Public Squiggle Models\n",
      "\n",
      "  * GiveWell's GiveDirectly cost effectiveness analysis by Sam Nolan\n",
      "  * A Critical Review of Open Philanthropy’s Bet On Criminal Justice Reform by Nuño Sempere\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Early Access\n",
      "\n",
      "We're calling this version \"Early Access.\" It's more stable than some alphas, but we'd like it to be more robust before a public official beta. Squiggle is experimental, and we plan on trying out some exploratory use cases for effective altruist use cases for at least the next several months. You can think of it like some video games in \"early access\"; they often have lots of exciting functionality but deprioritize the polish that published games often have. Great for a smaller group of engaged users, bad for larger organizations that expect robust stability or accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Should effective altruists really fund and develop their own programming language?\n",
      "\n",
      "It might seem absurd to create an \"entire programming language\" that's targeted at one community. However, after some experimentation and investigation, we concluded that it seems worth trying. Some points:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Domain-specific languages are already fairly common for sizeable companies with specific needs. They can be easier to build than one would think.\n",
      "  * We don't need a large library ecosystem. Much of the difficulty for programming languages comes from their library support, but the needs for most Squiggle programs are straightforward.\n",
      "  * The effective altruist community looks pretty unusual in its interest in probabilistic estimation, so it's not surprising that few products are a good fit.\n",
      "  * The main alternative options are proprietary and expensive risk analysis tools. It seems critical to have our community's models be public and easy to audit. Transparency doesn't work well if models require costly software to run.\n",
      "  * Much of the necessary work is in making decent probability distribution tooling for Javascript. This work itself could have benefits for forecasting and estimation websites. The \"programming language\" aspects might only represent one half the work of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Questions & Answers\n",
      "\n",
      "What makes Squiggle better than Guesstimate?\n",
      "\n",
      "Guesstimate is great for small models but can break down for larger or more demanding models. Squiggle scales much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plain text formats also allow for many other advantages. For example, you can use Github workflows with versioning, pull requests, and custom team access. \n",
      "\n",
      "Should I trust Squiggle calculations for my nuclear power plant calculations?\n",
      "\n",
      "No! Squiggle is still early and meant much more for approximation than precision. If the numbers are critical, we recommend checking them with other software. See this list of key known bugs and this list of gotchas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can other communities use Squiggle?\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely! We imagine it could be a good fit for many business applications. However, our primary focus will be on philanthropic use cases for the foreseeable future. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is there an online Squiggle community?\n",
      "\n",
      "There's some public discussion on Github. There's also a private EA/epistemics Slack with a few channels for Squiggle; message Ozzie to join. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Future Work\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, we're looking to hire a small team to advance Squiggle and its ecosystem. Some upcoming items:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Improve the core of the language. Add error types, improve performance, etc.\n",
      "  * Import functionality to allow Squiggle models to call other datasets or other Squiggle models.\n",
      "  * Command line tooling for working with large Squiggle codebases.\n",
      "  * Public web applications to share and discuss Squiggle models and values.\n",
      "  * Integration with forecasting platforms so that people can forecast using Squiggle models. (Note: If you have a forecasting platform and are interested in integrating Squiggle, please reach out!)\n",
      "  * Integration with more tools. Google Docs, Google Sheets, Airtable, Roam Research, Obsidian, Python, etc. (Note: This is an excellent area for external help!)\n",
      "  * Make web components for visualization and analysis of probability distributions in different circumstances. Ideally, most of these could be used without Squiggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Contribute to Squiggle\n",
      "\n",
      "If you'd like to contribute to Squiggle or the greater ecosystem, there's a lot of neat stuff to be done. \n",
      "\n",
      "  * Build integrations with other tools (see \"Future Work\" section above).\n",
      "  * Improve the documentation. It's currently fairly basic.\n",
      "  * Give feedback on the key features and the tools. (Particularly useful if you have experience with programming language design.)\n",
      "  * Suggest new features and report bugs.\n",
      "  * Audit and/or improve the internal numeric libraries.\n",
      "  * Make neat models and post them to the EA Forum or other blogs.\n",
      "  * Experiment with Squiggle in diverse settings. Be creative. There must be many very clever ways to use it with other Javascript ecosystems in ways we haven't thought of yet.\n",
      "  * Build tools on top of Squiggle. For example, Squiggle could help power a node-based graphical editor or a calendar-based time estimation tool. Users might not need to know anything about Squiggle; it would just be used for internal math.\n",
      "  * Implement Metalog distributions in Javascript. We really could use someone to figure this one out.\n",
      "  * Make open-source React components around probability distributions. These could likely be integrated fairly easily with Squiggle.\n",

      "I believe good governance is important and often underrated within EA.\n",

      "# Good Governance is Important\n",
      "\n",
      "My career as an investor has exposed me to a large variety of companies, CEOs and Boards.  A good idea, a good team and a good environment don't necessarily mean success.  Execution is vitally important and it's easy to go off track.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holden Karnofsky says that \"the board's #1 and most fundamental job is evaluating the CEO's performance\".  I do not disagree with that, but I think it is not quite as binary as he (likely accidentally) implies.  Successful governance that I have seen normally means:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * There is an alignment of interest between the shareholders (equivalent to beneficiaries) and the CEO, which cascades down the organisation.  On the other hand, I know many public[1] company CEOs that are very good at growing their company (and often their pay) in value-destructive ways, e.g. through overpriced acquisitions.\n",
      "  * The right CEO is in place for the right stage of the organisation's journey.  While there are notable exceptions, start-up CEOs aren’t often good at running large organisations.  When the size of the organisation changes, often the CEO needs to change.  Likewise, when the external environment changes and the key success factors for the organisation change, it sometimes requires a new skillset or personality type.\n",
      "  * The CEO has the right team around them.  I've met more than 100 large company CEOs and not one of them has it all.  Good CEOs recognise their own weaknesses.  The best CEOs empower people very different from them to plug the gaps.  However, perfect introspection is difficult and this is one of the key areas where the Board can work closely with the CEO to ensure there are no blind spots.\n",
      "  * The CEO is focused on what really matters.  Strategy and execution are very different.  If the strategy is well defined, it should be clear what you are trying to achieve, but day-to-day matters are much more mundane.  Achieving a big visions requires a lot of little choices and the CEO is often brought in to resolve the toughest of those little choices.  Even if you think you are good at the bigger picture, it is always helpful to report back to people who are solely focused on the North Star[2].\n",

      "# Good Governance is Often Underrated within EA\n",
      "\n",
      "The contribution of Boards is rarely discussed in EA circles.  On the EA Forum, there are only 2 posts before this one tagged \"non-profit governance\" and few posts talk about the role of Board Members.  Only a handful of organisations recruit widely for new Board members.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why is this?  Here are my hypotheses:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * EA is entrepreneurial.  When there are 100 reasons the organisation can fail, then governance is not top of the list.\n",
      "  * Governance is often perceived to be legalistic and risk-averse.  It is true that there is a certain legal minimum in most jurisdictions.  However, if they are occupying the majority of the Board's time, then I would argue that the Board is not spending enough time on its core functions (unless that is fulfilled by another body).\n",
      "  * Many EA organisations have very concentrated sources of funding.  Donors therefore often fulfil the accountability and governance functions.  Donors are analogous to customers, which can wield significant influence in for-profits[3].\n",
      "  * EA can be too academic.  The world is a lot more complex in reality.  Executing a good idea is much harder than coming up with one.  The right people, culture, structures and processes are more important than most people naturally assume.\n",
      "  * On average we are young and inexperienced.  We have not yet experienced a scandal / major problem and have not yet started to think through how to avoid that happening again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if we are aspiring to build large organisations that can really change the world, I don't think we should put up with these excuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "# How do we Create Effective Boards?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the first step towards effective boards is choosing the right board members.  At the same time, I think this is one of the hardest things to do.  Most non-profits start with a Board comprising friends of the founder.  This is bad for both cognitive diversity (people naturally hang out with people that are similar to them) and accountability (it's hard to be objective when you have a very strong personal bond with the CEO).\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first joined the EA Community, there were a handful of people in normal jobs and a bunch of students debating philosophy.  Now, there are around 10,000 active EAs.  The collective knowledge is huge, but underleveraged.  Diversity of experience and perspectives is vital for any board.  Every board should undertake a self-assessment to identify its gaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, I think we are also under-utilising the experience of EAs in the private sector.  Many people who became involved in EA in the early 2010s are now mid-career and many are in the private sector (earning to give was a key 80,000 Hours recommended at the time).  Many have experience of working in large organisations (which few people working within EA have currently).  Many are keen to be more involved with EA.  Many have experience of strategic decision-making and assessing CEOs.  Ongoing involvement with EA organisations is also likely to increase community engagement and reduce value drift.  Around a quarter of high-fidelity non-student EAs still earn to give.  I think at least one quarter of Board seats should be filled by EAs with significant business experience[4].\n",

While everything we publish should be useful (or at least interesting) to committed EAs, our audience is the wider penumbra of people who care about improving the world but aren't necessarily routine readers of, say, the EA forum.  \n",

      "While we expect the bulk of our pieces will be about typical EA cause areas (we think they’re important for a reason!), we’re a lot less interested in covering specific topics than in showcasing an \"EA-ish\" way of thinking about the world. We want to show off what this community does best: finding new ideas, taking them seriously, and investigating them rigorously – all while doing our best to reason under uncertainty. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re especially excited about pieces that help readers improve their epistemics and build better models of the world (the kinds of questions you’d see in the world-modeling tag on Less Wrong would all be within scope for us). We’d like to see smart writing about global catastrophic risks aimed at a wider audience, EA methods applied to topics we’ve never thought about, and historical case studies that help us understand the present. Here are a few representative examples of the kinds of questions we’d like to see people tackle: \n",
      "\n",
      "    * How can we predict the next pandemic? Are there plausible candidate pathogens outside the usual suspects (flu, pox or coronavirus)?\n",
      "    * What economic impacts of AI do we expect to see in the next five years? The next ten? Which industries will be impacted first?\n",
      "    * How was Oral Rehydration Therapy developed and rolled out? Why did it take until the 1960s when the underlying mechanism is so simple?\n",
      "    * The pessimists are probably right about lab grown meat for human consumption. Is there a niche for it anyway?\n",
      "    * Does the typical American cow lead a life worth living?\n",
      "    * We're approaching the 10 year anniversary of the replication crisis: what's changed, what hasn't?\n",
      "    * Net neutrality was repealed in 2018. At the time, everyone was convinced this would be the end of internet freedom. What's actually happened since, and why did so many people get it wrong?\n",
      "    * What lessons should the biosafety community draw from the Soviet & US cold war bio-warfare programs?\n",
      "    * Technology drives agricultural productivity in the US – what are the barriers to bringing that to the developing world?\n",
      "    * Effective PPE exists. What would it take to make it wearable and widely available?\n",
      "    * What do we know about the evolution of human intelligence, and what, if anything can it tell us about the development of artificial intelligence?\n",
      "    * How contingent is scientific progress? Is differential technological development possible, and if so, how can it be steered?\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, we’re not interested in pure philosophy, movement evangelism, or meta-EA and other inside baseball. Reports on the health of the community or various internal organizations can be interesting, but they don’t have the kind of broad appeal we’re looking for.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a software developer at a small IT company that has been developing a mobile application pro bono in collaboration with The Life You Can Save since October. We are doing this because we share EA values and want to do good in the world in the best way we can - and what we do best is software.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, a bit of background about me. I first came into contact with the ideas of effective altruism a couple of years ago by reading Practical Ethics by Peter Singer. Since then I have been both learning more and more about effective altruism and trying to apply its practices in my own life. I have a MSc in Software Engineering and currently live in Stockholm where I am active in an effective altruism group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now to the app we're making.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The problem\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, most people are not effective altruists (yet!). People mostly do good based on getting a happy, fuzzy feeling. The problem is that donating money to effective charities does not provide a significantly happy, fuzzy feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Goal of the App\n",
      "\n",
      "Make donating to effective charities provide a happy, fuzzy feeling. The focus is entirely on making people feel awesome by doing good effectively. Other, less effective charities are getting donations because they provide that fuzzy feeling, among other things. We want to create the same thing for effective organizations . \n",
      "\n",
      "## Target Group\n",
      "\n",
      "People who already donate money to charities but don't know about or are not convinced enough by EA to go through the \"hassle\" of donating effectively through GiveWell, The Life You Can Save, EA funds or other alternatives. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Competition/Inspiration\n",
      "\n",
      "A great example of a successful mobile charity application and an app from which we've drawn a lot of inspiration is Share The Meal. In their 2017 report it says 9,610,028 meals were shared thanks to donations made in the app. They've also received a ton of positive media exposure. All donations in the app go to the United Nation's World Food Programme which is not considered an effective charity. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are not competing with GiveWell, GWWC or EA funds since we believe they are focused on utilon donations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Our Solution\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea is to take a lot of inspiration from Share The Meal, because they do some things really well, then do some things even better, and make donations go to effective charities through The Life You Can Save instead of to WFP. \n",
      "\n",
      "## How you, the effective altruism community and the world can benefit from this\n",
      "\n",
      "I have personally had a struggle to convince people around me, good-hearted people that regularly donates money to charities, to donate to effective charities. It is just too much of a hassle for them. Having an app like this that can be shown to friends and family would make it much easier for them to try giving to effective charities, which could in turn be a gateway into effective altruism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## What we need help with: feedback!\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently held a successful launch party at our office in Stockholm and received a lot of positive feedback. We are committed to this project and right now we need more user testing and feedback. We figured the natural place to find testers was the EA forum since the app is based upon the ideas of effective altruism and you are all experienced at giving intelligent feedback and constructive criticism. \n",
      "\n",
      "## How to get involved\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Download the app! We would love for you to download the app and try it out yourself. The released version is only available in Sweden so far, but the beta is available worldwide on both iOS and Android. (The released Swedish version is available on App Store and Google Play Store)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Give feedback! We'd love to hear your thoughts about this project so please comment below or feel free to send an email to tlycs-feedback@meepo.se. If you're going to use this app, great! If not, what would make you use it?\n",
      "\n",
      "3\\. Future ideas? We will continue to develop this app and would love to hear what features or functionality you would most like to see to use an app like this.\n",

      "# Announcing Effective Altruism Community Building Grants  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm announcing a new project from the Centre for Effective Altruism: Effective Altruism Community Building Grants. This program will provide grants of between $5,000 and $100,000 to individuals and groups doing local effective altruism community building work. We expect to have a particular emphasis on funding groups aiming to transition from being run by volunteers to being run by full-time, paid organizers. We are currently in talks with LEAN about how we will collaborate on administering/implementing grants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aim of this project is to build the capacity of the effective altruism community to produce value, by strengthening a small number of high-potential effective altruism groups. We believe that community building grants will help achieve this aim for the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "    * Providing these grants will enable the people with the most expertise and personal fit for local community building to significantly increase the time they can dedicate to building the highest potential effective altruism groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "    * Increasing the groups' organizational capacity in this way will significantly increase the number of highly talented people dedicated to working on the most important problems, as a result of understanding the ideas and methodology of effective altruism (furthering CEAs charitable object No. 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Providing grants for effective altruism community builders promises to be a scalable way of using funding to increase the talent pool available to the effective altruism community. Upon completing the first round of effective altruism community building grants, we expect to further increase our understanding of both the specific contribution that effective altruism groups can make to the aims of the community, and the role that additional funding can play in strengthening effective altruism groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though we expect the typical application to be for a grant to cover full-time or part-time work organizing an effective altruism group, we are open to grant applications which are outside of this scope but are focused on the aim of creating successful local effective altruism communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Current Landscape\n",
      "\n",
      "CEA's mission is to improve humanity's long-term trajectory by building a community that can work together to solve humanity's biggest problems. Right now, there are three main mechanisms by which individual EAs can come together as a community: online (e.g. EA Forum, Facebook), yearly conferences (e.g. EA Global) and local groups (e.g. university groups like Harvard EA and community groups like EA London).\n",
      "\n",
      "Local groups provide the only option for regular, in-person interaction within the EA community. We think this is likely to be essential to a thriving EA community for at least three reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "    * Regular in-person interactions are essential to establishing informal information networks, which are particularly useful as a way to learn things you didn't know you needed to know.\n",
      "    * Regular in-person interactions facilitate strong connections within community, and these connections are likely to be essential to helping many people remain stably motivated to work on improving the world.\n",
      "    * Regular in-person interaction is a good method for introducing new people to the community.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of local groups appears to follow a heavy-tailed distribution, with some of the larger, more established groups producing substantially more value than the average local group. Historically, much of the local group support provided by CEA, Rethink Charity, EAF and others has focused on either seeding local groups or providing a small amount of support to a large number of different groups. EA Community Building Grants are an experiment in shifting our focus towards making some of the most promising local groups even better.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, CEA has considered similar plans, but ultimately decided not to push forward for three reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "    * EA community size\n",
      "\n",
      "      * The effective altruism community used to be much smaller than it is now, both in terms of the number of people who identified with the aims of the community, and the reach of the ideas of effective altruism.\n",
      "\n",
      "      * Local groups need to be able to reach a critical mass of regular attendees to succeed. As the number of people in the community has grown, reaching critical mass has become easier, resulting in more groups gaining significant traction.\n",
      "\n",
      "    * High opportunity cost for group leaders\n",
      "\n",
      "      * The best way for group leaders to attract excellent people to their group is for them to be personally excellent themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "      * However, this means that the best group leaders are also likely to have the highest opportunity costs. We weren't sure that we knew enough about the overall value of local groups to know when a group leader should focus on their local group full time instead of pursuing other options.\n",
      "\n",
      "    * Entrenchment\n",
      "\n",
      "      * When a stable local group forms, it's typically the case that no one else attempts to form a competing local group. This is generally quite positive and represents good norms of cooperation rather than defection.\n",
      "\n",
      "      * However, this creates a lock-in effect whereby the first stable local group crowds out the possibility of different groups forming in the future. Funding full-time organizers exacerbates this effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "      * As the EA community grows, the importance of local groups will grow as will the quality of the local organizer talent pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "      * This means that funding a local group today could mean that we can't fund a better instantiation of that group in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few things have changed such that we think now is a good time to provide funding for local groups that want to professionalize.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the size of the EA community has grown. Local groups serve as an early contact point for people who learn about EA. Therefore as the reach of the ideas of effective altruism grows larger, more people are learning about EA and the more valuable it is for local groups to serve as a first point of contact with the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, we've been increasingly impressed with the productive output of some of the local groups we've talked to. This makes it more likely that running a local group is better than the alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, we've gained a better understanding of what constitutes a promising local group and how local groups can produce value. For example, we've come to believe that a major comparative advantage of effective altruism groups is in supporting group members to develop high-value future plans, and that groups can achieve this aim more effectively by building strong (rather than simply large) communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, the available funding in the EA community has increased whereas important talent gaps remain. This project may be able to turn money into talent which makes it especially promising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we think we can set clear expectations with the groups that we fund such that the project is viewed as an experiment and that part of the goal of the experiment is to determine whether the local group leaders should continue working on community-building full time.\n",
      "\n",
      "# The Ideal Candidate\n",
      "\n",
      "In making funding decisions, we're looking for two main things: exceptional organizers, and high-potential groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Organizers\n",
      "\n",
      "In the simplest terms, the heuristic for evaluating organizers is \"Would we be excited to replicate these people 10x or 100x in the EA community?\" This heuristic is inspired by YC's advice on hiring and culture, and we think it encapsulates the importance of local community builders in setting the culture and trajectory of the EA community.\n",
      "\n",
      "More specifically, we expect the organizers to have the following characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "    * EA expertise\n",
      "\n",
      "      * If you want to spread EA you should first be an expert on EA.\n",
      "\n",
      "      * This doesn't mean that you need to be a cutting edge researcher. It does mean that you should have a thorough, nuanced understanding of the core EA ideas, and that you should be able to map out the considerations surrounding questions like what cause area to support, or what careers to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "    * Adherence to the guiding principles of effective altruism\n",
      "\n",
      "      * We want to fund organizers who adhere to the core principles of commitment to others, scientific mindset, openness, integrity and collaborative spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "    * Judgment\n",
      "\n",
      "      * We aim to take a relatively hands-off approach to the groups we fund. This means that we will tend to prefer organizers who we trust will tend to make reasonable, well-considered decisions and who display appropriate caution about difficult or risky decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "    * Skill at EA community building\n",
      "\n",
      "      * We'll also look for evidence that organizers possess skill at EA community building. The core heuristic for assessing this is \"Will this person be able to attract talented, dedicated people to make major contributions on the most important problems?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "      * There are many different ways of meeting this heuristic, but we expect to evaluate areas like social skill, executional competence, enthusiasm, and thoughtfulness, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "    * Understanding of EA community building\n",
      "\n",
      "      * EA community building has the potential for being both highly valuable, but also harmful if done poorly. Organizers should have a very strong understanding of the relevant considerations determining the value of EA community building.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Group\n",
      "\n",
      "We're looking for groups that are likely to have a strong potential to flourish given a significant increase in their resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building on our experience at Y Combinator and their emphasis on building services for your 100 most dedicated users, we think one of the most important qualities of high-potential groups is the depth of engagement and understanding of the groups' core members. This is intended to be a departure from assessing groups based on metrics related to size, such as event attendance or number of members.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are looking for groups with the potential to facilitate the development of people who contribute valuable work to high-priority areas, Specifically, the features that we expect to see are:\n",
      "\n",
      "    * An inner core of well-coordinated organizers\n",
      "\n",
      "      * Successful local groups need to be able to attract a small inner core of people who can help make the group succeed. The inner core typically consists of people who aren't working on the group full time, but attend events regularly, are willing to pitch in to help when needed and who the leaders can turn to for support and advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "    * Stable, highly-engaged group members\n",
      "\n",
      "      * This is a group of people who attend fairly regularly, don't generally help with organizing events, but who are otherwise highly engaged and derive significant value from the group.\n",
      "\n",
      "    * A goal-oriented activity portfolio\n",
      "\n",
      "      * This will consist of activities and projects which have been chosen on the basis of a developing understanding of the goals of the effective altruism community, and how they will contribute to achieving these goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "    * A record of past success in attracting talented, dedicated people to make major contributions to the most important problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "      * This includes looking at whether people currently in the group seem like they could make such a contribution in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "# The Grants\n",
      "\n",
      "The grant period lasts for between three months and a year, and applicants may choose to delay the start of the grant period until the start of September 1st, 2018. By default, grants will be paid out on a quarterly basis, although there is flexibility in the payment schedule to accommodate the needs of grantees. Grant recipients will be required to write a brief quarterly report, including an itemized list of expenditures, as well as periodically checking in with CEA. Groups will also be required to write a full report at the end of the grant period.\n",
      "\n",
      "For applications for a grant to cover full-time work organizing an effective altruism group, the default grant will be $35,000 to cover the living costs of one organizer over the course of a year, in additional to $10,000 for general expenses related to the group itself. For applications for funding below $5,000, see the effective altruism groups funding guide instead. Individual or joint applications may be submitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "CEA will only be able to make grants which further some of its charitable objects, which are stated within the application form. CEA is not an employer of those to whom it awards grants, and reserves the right to terminate payment of the grants should they deviate from the agreed-upon terms.\n",
      "\n",

      "    * There isn't much advice from the effective altruism community on how to have an impact with technology.\n",
      "    * There's a lot of existing expert knowledge on doing good with technology that would be much easier to access and consume as an individual if it were made accessible, collated and analysed.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a personal level, the project speaks to our own needs. Both of us are software developers who would like to have direct impact with our work, but who feel that we don't know how to do that effectively. We believe that there are many others in a similar position.\n",

      "We are starting by interviewing experts both in cause areas and in technologies, and creating case studies of existing high-impact technology projects. In the long term we hope to provide a guide to assessing the impact of novel projects, a list of project suggestions, and strategies for coming up with good ideas.\n",

      "There are problems with our approach. There's clearly overlap with EA Ventures, GiveWell, OpenPhilanthropy Project, and 80,000 Hours. It's also unclear whether we should expect to be able to find good, tractable opportunities. We'll be writing more about our strategy and testing our assumptions in the future, but we'd appreciate any comments or suggestions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where does the project fit in the effective altruism community?\n",
      "\n",
      "80,000 Hours recently argued that the effective altruism community should concentrate more on filling talent gaps. We see our project as serving this need of shifting talent to more effective direct work.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also plan to use existing work as much as possible. For example, when exploring causes we should be able to use the existing work from GiveWell and the Open Philanthropy Project. We also want to tap into the large pool of academic research around technical interventions, such as within the ICT for Development (ICT4D) field.\n",
      "\n",
      "The organisation we are most likely to overlap with is 80,000 Hours, given that they aim to direct the work of talented people by giving advice. However, 80,000 Hours can't do a detailed investigation of every career path, and within any career the bracket of \"direct work\" leaves a huge amount to be investigated. We could certainly see room for similar organizations in other areas like politics, health, or research, and we'd like to collaborate with them on finding important problems.\n",

      "  * Rethink Priorities (RP) has launched a Special Projects (SP) Program to help start promising EA initiatives by providing fiscal sponsorship and full-service operational support–including, but not limited to hiring, finance, event planning, and communications. \n",
      "  * A key strength of RP is its operations. We have been able to scale the organization from 1.5 full-time equivalents (FTE) staff to nearly 50 FTE in just four years.\n",
      "  * The SP Program advances projects that RP would like to see happen and allows these projects to focus on their core work rather than worrying about running their organization.\n",
      "  * Current special projects include Epoch, the Insect Welfare Project, Unjournal, EA Market Testing, Condor Camp, and EA Pathfinder.\n",
      "  * There are various ways to get involved in the SP Program: join our team, apply to have your project sponsored, or share with us lessons you’ve learned incubating projects if you have experience in this arena. Please reach out by submitting an Expression of Interest form. \n",

      "# About Rethink Priorities\n",
      "\n",
      "Founded in 2018, RP is dedicated to informing decisions made by high-impact organizations and funders across various cause areas. To date, our team has conducted over 50 person-years of work (you can find all our public research here). One of our key strengths is our operational capacity, which allows us to recruit, onboard, and support talented researchers to produce quality work with minimal bureaucratic red tape. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given our strong operations, RP would like to support other promising EA projects – particularly longtermist ones – in getting off the ground. To this end, we recently launched a new Special Projects Program.  \n",
      "\n",
      "# About the Special Projects Program\n",
      "\n",
      "As an off-shoot of our Operations Department, Special Projects is a distinct team dedicated to supporting the launch of new projects rather than running RP’s day-to-day operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team’s Acting Director Carolyn Footitt is leading this work with Associates María De la Lama and Cristina Schmidt Ibáñez. Their projects generally fall under two areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. Incubated (internal)–In addition to our research agenda, RP is incubating direct work and other projects that advance our mission. The SP Team works closely with RP staff to launch these initiatives. Once the incubation period for each respective initiative ends, the project will either conclude or spin-off to become an independent organization. \n",
      "  2. Fiscally sponsored (external)–The SP Team is also providing fee-based fiscal sponsorship and support to projects that are managed by individuals outside of RP. Within this model, the project’s founders maintain autonomy and decision-making authority while we provide them with operational and fiduciary oversight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Our services\n",
      "\n",
      "Although our involvement will depend on the project, in general, the SP Team will provide operational support to projects much in the way that our Core Operations Team supports RP’s work. Such services might include developing and managing budgets, accounting, contracting, running hiring rounds, planning the onboarding of new staff, hosting and developing the project website, and other operations tasks outlined in the below chart.  \n",
      "\n",
      "## Current Special Projects\n",
      "\n",
      "The SP Team is currently incubating the following projects:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * LAISR, an AI strategy retreat\n",
      "  * The provisionally-named Insect Welfare Project to address welfare concerns around the growing insect farming industry\n",
      "  * Unjournal, an open platform for research relevant to global priorities\n",
      "  * EA Market Testing, a survey on how to best promote effective giving and action\n",
      "  * EA Pathfinder, an initiative to advise and support mid-career professionals looking to switch into EA work\n",
      "  * Condor Camp, an EA and longtermism training and community-building project in Brazil\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The SP Team also helped to launch Epoch, a new AI research initiative, which we are continuing to fiscally sponsor. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Highlights  \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "From late July to early August, Condor Camp held its first retreat with 13 highly talented Brazilian university students. Seminars and workshops focused on how to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems, including AI safety, pandemics, biosecurity, global health and poverty, and animal welfare. Following this event, RP’s Associate Researcher Renan Araújo is now:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Keeping the camp’s alumni engaged with EA projects\n",
      "  * Gathering lessons that may be relevant for other EA training projects\n",
      "  * Strategizing how to maintain momentum in building the EA movement in Brazil and throughout Latin America\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "RP has been helping Epoch to hire for multiple research roles. Supporting the initiative’s operations frees up the researchers’ time so they can focus on their work. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus far, the researchers have already done a deep dive into machine learning model size trends in which they identified distinct patterns in vision and language model sizes over time and hypothesized reasons for these patterns. \n",
      "\n",
      "Through this type of work, Epoch aims to support strategy and forecasting around the development of transformative artificial intelligence–AI that could have an impact as significant as the industrial revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "## We’re seeking new projects\n",
      "\n",
      "RP is interested in fiscally sponsoring additional projects that are aligned with our mission and values. Currently, we are especially interested in longtermist megaprojects, but this is not a requirement; we are open to hearing about any initiative in the EA space. Some sample projects might include (but are certainly not limited to): civilizational refuges, EA early warning forecasting, and red-teaming initiatives. If in doubt, please do not hesitate to reach out to the Special Projects Team. \n",

      "We’ve had effective COVID vaccines for more than a year, but there are still countries where less than 10% of people have received a dose. Omicron has been spreading for almost three months, but pharma companies have only just started testing variant-specific shots. mRNA vaccines are highly effective, but they’re hard to manufacture and nearly impossible to distribute in parts of the developing world.\n",
      "\n",
      "We won’t be ready for the next variant, or the next pandemic, until these problems are solved. \n",
      "\n",
      "An ideal vaccine platform for pandemic preparedness would be fast, effective, cheap, robust, and scalable enough to reach a critical portion of the global population as soon as any new pathogen is identified. Ideas have been floating around the EA biosecurity community for years about what such a platform would look like, and what it would take to build it, but there hasn’t been much direct work in the space.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most recent COVID wave convinced a few of us that it was time for that to change, so we launched Alvea to rapidly develop and deploy an Omicron-specific vaccine. In doing so, we’re aiming to build a platform for responding to future COVID variants or other novel pathogens, and to massively level up the technical, operational, clinical, organizational, and logistical capabilities of the longtermist biosecurity community. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve initially structured Alvea as a three-month sprint to test the hypothesis that an exceptionally bright, dedicated group of people can quickly accomplish remarkable things in this space. In the past eight weeks, we’ve built a team of 35 drug developers, logistics experts, physicians, operators, and scientists to bring the project to fruition. We’re supported by a network of consultants and partners with deep experience in every aspect of vaccine development and infectious disease response. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many of us are longtermist EAs who believe this project has a shot at transformative impact on biosecurity. All of us are committed to radically improving vaccine development, and are working around the clock to make this happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our strategy at Alvea is simple: We’re building a streamlined platform for developing and deploying DNA vaccines using safe, well-validated components. DNA vaccines function similarly to mRNA vaccines, but are easier to produce and can be shipped around the world with no special storage requirements. Ultimately, we expect people to be able to easily self-administer our vaccines anywhere on the planet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Getting our vaccines into the clinic—and out to the places where they’re needed—requires solving a staggering number of problems in preclinical development, manufacturing, international regulation, clinical trial design, logistics, and other areas, all at the same time. In many cases, the standard approaches to these problems are riddled with crippling inefficiencies. We’re eliminating those when we can, and building from scratch when we can’t. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the 60 days since our inception, we’ve designed twelve versions of our Omicron vaccine, responded to the emergence of the BA.2 subvariant, produced hundreds of doses of our lead candidate, run preclinical experiments in mice and sheep, kicked off scalable manufacturing processes, planned Phase I and II clinical studies, and identified potential partner countries for accelerated trials. There’s an enormous amount of work still to be done, but we are well on our way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alvea is led by Ethan Alley and Grigory Khimulya (Co-CEOs), Cate Hall, and Kyle Fish. Our team is growing rapidly, and we’re particularly keen to expand in the following areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "    * Wet laboratory (molecular biology, in vitro and in vivo development)\n",
      "    * Clinical trial operations and logistics\n",

      "# Aims\n",
      "\n",
      "The Forethought Foundation works in close collaboration with the Global Priorities Institute (GPI) at Oxford University to promote academic research in global priorities research, particularly focused on issues around whether and how to positively influence the long-term future. We are therefore interested in supporting excellent research that:  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    * Defends or criticises the idea that we should primarily care about the very long-term impact of our actions. \n",
      "    * Works out the implications of a long-term view for our decisions today.\n",
      "    * Is of importance for the very long-term future, even if the research is not directly about the idea of long-term impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Relationship with GPI\n",
      "\n",
      "While GPI offers a variety of different programmes for researchers of all stages in their career to get involved at research in Oxford, the Forethought Foundation aims to extend its efforts outside of Oxford University, and support academics worldwide in their research pursuits. \n",
      "\n",
      "# Current and Potential Projects\n",
      "\n",
      "    * The Global Priorities Fellowship: This fellowship aims to support promising PhD and master’s students in philosophy and economics to contribute to global priorities research, with a particular focus on issues that are of relevance to the very long-term future. Applications are open to full-time students at any stage of their studies, including those starting their programmes in the autumn of 2019. The application deadline is 27 December 2018. Fellows will receive a stipend of £5,000 (about US $6,500) per year of their fellowship and can attend a yearly fellows’ event in Oxford. Fellows will also get an exclusive opportunity to apply for full funding of their doctorate or master’s programme.\n",
      "    * Major research grants: We don’t currently have an open round for major research grants, but you can register your interest on our website. \n",
      "    * Supporting the Global Priorities Institute in its mission by taking measures to improve visitor experience, save staff time and advise on strategy.\n",
